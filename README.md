The goal of this worker is to standardize the formatting

to standardize the output text (html) for when someone does not done. Basically, when someone marks an action as not done, they fill out the tiptap for not done (why not, what will you do, etc). If formatting is jacked up there, then it looks shitty in pre-read and Matt complained a few times about it. No matter how much i tried standardizing to place inside li/ul tags, it kept having edge cases so i said fuck it and made an llm call to always return as ul/li items
